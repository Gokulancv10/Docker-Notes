# Docker Notes

## What is a Docker?
    - Docker is a tool that allows you to package and run application on a containerized environment.
    - Docker simplifies the development, testing and deployment of applications, making it a popular choice among developers and DevOps team.

## What is a container?
    - A container is a lightweight virtual machine that contains everything your applications needs to run, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries.
    - In other wrods, containers are lightweight, executable application components that combine application source code with all operating system (os) libraries and dependencies required to run the code in any environment.

## What is the purpose of Docker?
    - Simplify the process of building, deploying and managing applictaions by providing a standardized way to package and distriute them.
    - developers can create a containerized version of their application, along with all of its dependencies, and then deploy it on any platform that supports Docker. This makes it easier to move applications between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without having to worry about compatibility issues or differences in the underlying infrastructure.
